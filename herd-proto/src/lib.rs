//! Herd's wire contract.
//!
//! Every message a hub, a runner or a requester sends lives here and nowhere
//! else (CLAUDE.md invariant 4). The crate does no I/O: it defines the message
//! types, the protocol version, and the JSON framing used on the WebSocket.
//!
//! Framing (D4): one message per WebSocket **text** frame, a serde-tagged
//! JSON object carrying its variant in `"type"`.
